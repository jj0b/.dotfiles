# .dotfiles

This sets a macOS machine up with my preferred tooling and theme, [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/). The `install.sh` script sets up `fish` shell but if you prefer `zsh` I have a `zsh` folder that you could stow. With `zsh` you could install `starship` from `homebrew` for a nice prompt.

## Prerequisites

### Nerd Fonts Symbols Only

- Download and install `Symbols Nerd Font` from [https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.0.0/NerdFontsSymbolsOnly.zip](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.0.0/NerdFontsSymbolsOnly.zip).
- Download and install `JetBrainsMono Nerd Font` from [https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.0.0/JetBrainsMono.zip](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.0.0/JetBrainsMono.zip).

## Installation

- Clone this repository and run the install script:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jj0b/.dotfiles.git
cd .dotfiles
./install.sh
```

## Usage

For custom key commands for `vim` and `tmux` you can checkout the `cheatsheet.md` which is aliased to `cs`.
